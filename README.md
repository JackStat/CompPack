[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JackStat/CompPack.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JackStat/CompPack)


The functions for this package were developed from a class taken at the University of Utah taught by Alun Thomas.


To install this package run the following code.  Note that the package changes often and new functions are added all the time so this code can also be used to update the package.

```
require(devtools)
install_github("CompPack", "JackStat")
require(CompPack)
```
